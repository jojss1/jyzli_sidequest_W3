## Description

This p5.js project presents a simple interactive story built with a state-based, multi-screen structure. The game guides players through a short narrative with binary choices, tracks a single stat across scenes, and routes players to different outcomes based on their decisions. The project emphasizes clear separation of screens into individual files, basic state management, and readable interaction logic.
